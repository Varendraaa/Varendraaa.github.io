## About Me

I'm a newly minted **software developer** that loves to blend his creative and technical sides into creating fun products that users enjoy. In my spare time, I'm just a chill guy that enjoys weightlifting, photography and cooking.

## How I Got Here

I originally obtained my Bachelor's in Petroleum Geoscience from the University of the West Indies, and spent the next 5+ years as a Geophysicist within the local Oil and Gas Industry, focusing on seismic data analysis and interpretation, data management and policy development. I was able to work on some amazing projects, such as hydrocarbon resource analysis of offshore deepwater environments, and development of a policy framework to guide licensing round evaluations.

Although I enjoyed what I was doing, I began suffering from burnout and overwork, likely a leftover effect from the Covid-19 pandemic times. Since I was always interested in software development, and had already begun automating my day to day analytical workflows using Python, I decided to take a risk to pivot away and pursue my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Dundee.

Moving to a completely new country to study in a bid to take my career in a new direction was a surreal experience. I'm truly grateful that I was able to make that choice for myself, as I met some amazing people and got to learn so many things. I graduated as the **Best Overall Student** in my MSc cohort, and I'm looking forward to things ahead.
